## Project: StoreMando

**StoreMando** is an integrated platform fully customised for residents in households, residential colleges and halls,
to help users manage their items effectively and efficiently. StoreMando allows users to keep track of their items'
whereabouts, quantities and expiry dates with a few simple commands. Furthermore, StoreMando also comes with an inbuilt
reminder feature to help users keep track of items that are expiring. All items' information is encapsulated clearly on
our simple and clean Graphical User Interface (GUI). Our application is optimised for use via the Command Line
Interface (CLI) and if users have quick fingers, StoreMando can help users manage their items in the blink of an eye.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to sort items in the list.
  (Pull request [\#101](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-W10-2/tp/pull/101))
    * What it does: This feature allows the user to sort items in the displayed list by quantity or expiry date. For
      sort by expiry date, items will be sorted by items with earliest expiry date to latest expiry date. For sort by
      quantity, items are sorted in ascending order of quantity.
    * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can view the items with expiry dates
      nearing and items with stocks running low. Users can thus remember to finish such items quickly or restock on such
      items.
    * Highlights: It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation was challenging as I did
      not know how to constantly update the list while keeping its attribute final. I also had to update the list being
      displayed which took in a predicate to update unlike sort which required a comparator to be updated.
