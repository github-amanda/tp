### Architecture

![Architecture Diagram of StoreMando](images/ArchitectureDiagram.png)

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of
each component.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">

:bulb: **Tip:** The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in
the [diagrams](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-W10-2/tp/tree/master/docs/diagrams) folder. Refer to the [_PlantUML
Tutorial_ at se-edu/guides](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/plantUml.html) to learn how to create and edit
diagrams.

</div>

**`Main`** has two classes
called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-W10-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/storemando/Main.java)
and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-W10-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/storemando/MainApp.java).
It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component) The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component) The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component) Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component) Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components,

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* exposes its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which implements the corresponding
  API `interface` mentioned in the previous point).

The ***Sequence Diagram*** below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues
the command `delete 5`.

![Sequence Diagram of the Architecture](images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png)

**The sections below give more details of each component.**

### UI component

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

**API** :
[`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-W10-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/storemando/ui/Ui.java)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts `CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `ItemListPanel`
, `LocationListPanel` and `ReminderPanel`. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are
in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of
the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-W10-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/storemando/ui/MainWindow.java)
is specified
in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-W10-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

### Logic component

![Structure of the Logic Component](images/LogicClassDiagram.png)

**API** :
[`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-W10-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/storemando/logic/Logic.java)

1. `Logic` uses the `StoreMandoParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding an item).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
1. In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying
   help to the user.
   
Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 5")` API
calls respectively.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">

:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a 
limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

### Model component

![Structure of the Model Component](images/ModelClassDiagram.png)

**API** :
[`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-W10-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/storemando/model/Model.java)

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences.
* stores the StoreMando data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Item>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that
  the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

### Storage component

![Structure of the Storage Component](images/StorageClassDiagram.png)

**API** :
[`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103T-W10-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/storemando/storage/Storage.java)

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the StoreMando data in json format and read it back.

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.storemando.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

### Add feature `add`

#### Actual Implementation

The `add` feature allows users to add an item's details to the inventory. An item's details is made up of it's name, 
quantity, location, expiry date (optional), and tags (optional).

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">
:information_source: **Note:** 
An item's name, quantity and location are compulsory fields that must be supplied by the user.
</div>

The Sequence Diagram below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user
issues the command `add n/apple q/2 l/kitchen`.

![AddSequenceDiagram](images/AddSequenceDiagram.png)


From the diagram above:

1. When the user keys in a command string, `execute` command of the `LogicManager` is called with the given string as input.
2. In the method, `LogicManager` calls on the `parseCommand` method of `StoreMandoParser` to parse the user input.
3. The `StoreMandoParser` parses the user input and identifies it as an `AddCommand` and instantiates `AddCommandParser`. 
4. `StoreMandoParser` then invokes the `parse` method of `AddCommandParser` to further parse the arguments provided. In the `parse` method,
   the `AddCommandParser` ensures that the input is of the correct format and identifies the input for the item name, quantity, 
   location, expiry date and tag(s).
5. If all the arguments of the `add` command are valid, The `AddCommandParser` creates a new `Item` object, 
   and instantiates a new `AddCommand` object that contains the `Item` object. This `AddCommand` object will be
   returned to the `LogicManager`.
6. The `LogicManager` will then invoke the `execute` method of the `AddCommand` object with `model` as argument.   
7. Consequently, `AddCommand` object will add the `Item` object to `Model`, and return a `CommandResult` to `LogicManager`.
8. This `CommandResult` will be returned at the end.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new `add` command:
![AddActivityDiagram](images/AddActivityDiagram.png)

##### Proposed Improvements
1. Items with the same name, location and expiry date cannot co-exist in the inventory. Thus, every item that 
   is to be added has to be checked and validated that it is not a duplicate item. The current implementation to do so
   involves iterating through the list of all items to check if there already exists an item in the inventory that has 
   exactly the same name, location and expiry date. This process is slow and runs in O(n) time. It can be improved by 
   implementing a `HashMap` containing all the items currently stored in the inventory. This will allow the search to be 
   done in O(1) time. This feature was not implemented as it would introduce unnecessary complexity, and the current 
   solution meets the non-functional requirements regarding performance.

##### Design Considerations:

##### Aspect: Identifying the addition of duplicate item
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Compare item to be added and existing items in the inventory by name, location 
  **and** expiry date.
    * Pros: Allows users to store the same products that may have been produced in different batches. This would also 
      help users identify and differentiate similar products by their expiry date.
    * Cons: Items with the same name and location may be a potential source of confusion.

* **Alternative 2:** Compare item to be added and existing items in the inventory by name and location only.
    * Pros: Allows users to clearly distinguish items with the same names by location. This would prevent confusion and
      save users from going through the hassle of distinguishing items by expiry date.
    * Cons: Users would not be able to store similar items that have different expiry dates as a result of being 
      produced in different batches.



### Edit feature
The edit feature allows the user to edit an item's name, quantity, location, expiry date and tag. This will help the
user to not delete and add back an item upon inputting an incorrect item. <br>
The edit command has the following format: `edit INDEX [n/ITEM NAME] [l/LOCATION] [q/QUANTITY] [e/EXPIRY_DATE] [t/TAG]...`
and only changes the specified attribute.

:information_source: : Things to note
- Even though the edit command expects the user input to only have multiple tag prefixes, it still allows
  other prefixes to be declared more than once. However, StoreMando only parses the last common prefix input to update the
  item.

#### Implementation
![EditSequenceDiagram](images/EditSequenceDiagram.png)

Step 1: The user inputs `edit 1 n/apple` wanting to change the first item's name.

Step 2: The input is passed to `LogicManager` in a form of a String.

Step 3: The input string is passed to `StoreMandoParser` for it to be parsed.

Step 4: The input string is separated into command keyword and arguments containing the prefixes with the updated item's
attribute.

Step 5: The argument is passed to `EditCommandParser` to check if the user input follows the edit command format.

Step 6: `EditCommandParser` creates `EditItemDescriptor` through `EditCommand`.

Step 7: Based on the user input string, the `EditItemDescriptor` updates its own attributes.

Step 8: `EditCommandParser` creates an `EditCommand` with the item index and `EditItemDescriptor`.

Step 9: The new `EditCommand` is pass from `EditCommandParser` back to `LogicManager`.

Step 10: `LogicManager` then calls the **execute** method of `EditCommand`.

Step 11: `EditCommand` calls **getFilteredList** method to get the list of item from `Model`. It also calls the
**createEditedItem** method to create the edited item.

Step 12: From the index argument of `EditCommand`, it gets the targeted item from the list of items and set it to the
edit item.

Step 13: `EditCommand` will create a `CommandResult` and pass to `LogicManager` with message containing the edited
item's description and possibly some warning.

Step 14: Depending on the entire execution, the `LogicManager` either receive an exception or the `CommandResult`. The
GUI proceeds to show it on the result display.

#### Activity Diagram
![EditActivityDiagram](images/EditActivityDiagram.png)

#### Design consideration:

##### Aspect: How Edit executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Doesn't allow edit item to have the same field as the original item.
    * Pros: User will be notified if original items are not being edited.
    * Cons: Harder to implement

* **Alternative 2:** Allow edit item to have the same fields as the original item.
    * Pros: Easy to implement.
    
### Delete Item `Delete`

#### Actual Implementation

The `delete` feature allows users to delete an item in their Inventory by the item's index in the list.

The following sequence diagram shows how the delete operation works:

![DeleteSequenceDiagram](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

Given below is an example usage scenario and how delete mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. User executes `delete 5` to delete the 5th item in the list. `StoreMandoParser` takes in the user input and
determines the command word (delete) and argument (5) respectively.

Step 2. An instance of `DeleteCommandParser` will be created, followed by a call on its `parse` method, taking in the
argument stated in step 1 (5).

Step 3. The `parse` method will check for the validity of the index. If valid, a new `DeleteCommand` instance will be
created and returned to `LogicManager` class via `StoreMandoParser` class.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">

:information_source: **Note:** If the index is determined to be invalid, a parseException will be thrown to notify the
user of the error.

</div>

Step 4. The overridden `execute` method of `DeleteCommand` will be called, deleting the item from the list.

Step 5. Finally, a `CommandResult` object is created and returned to `LogicManager`.

![DeleteActivityDiagram](images/DeleteActivityDiagram.png)

##### Aspect: How `delete` executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Delete item by an index.
    * Pros: Easy to implement.
    * Cons: Requires user to scroll through the list to find the item and specify the index.

* **Alternative 2:** Delete item by item name.
    * Pros: Will be easier for the user especially when the list is huge.
    * Cons: There are items with the same name but in different location, will cause confusion.

### Find Item `find KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS]` or `find */KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS]`

#### Actual Implementation

The `find KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS]` and `find */KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS]` features find and display all items whose names
contain any of the given keywords, either in full or partially respectively.

The Sequence Diagram below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user
keys in the command `find Chocolate`:
![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `find KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS]` Command](images/FindFullSequenceDiagram.png)

The Sequence Diagram below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user
keys in the command `find */cheese egg`:
![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `find */KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS]` Command](images/FindPartialSequenceDiagram.png)

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the find operation behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user execute `find Chocolate` to find all the items in the inventory whose names fully match the keyword.
`StoreMandoParser` takes in the user input and determines the command word (find) and argument ("Chocolate") respectively.

Step 2. An instance of `FindCommandParser` will be created, followed by a call on its `parse` method, taking in the
argument stated in step 1 ("Chocolate").

Step 3. The `parse` method will check for the presence of keyword(s). If keywords are present, a new `FindCommand` instance will be
created and returned to `LogicManager` class via `StoreMandoParser` class.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info"> 
:information_source: **Note:** If the command format is determined to be invalid, a parseException will be thrown to notify the
user of the error.
</div>

Step 4. The overridden `execute` method will be called. The current predicate and filtered item list of the `Model` will
be updated, and all items in the inventory that matches the keyword in full will be listed. An instance of
`CommandResult` will be created, generating the result of the execution. The String parameter passed in the `CommandResult` depends
on whether the number of items that matched the keyword is more than one or less than two. The `LogicManager` class will receive the
result of the execution.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

![FindActivityDiagram](images/FindActivityDiagram.png)

#### Design consideration:

##### Aspect: How find executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Find items in the current list that matches the keyword, either fully or partially.
    * Pros: Easy to implement.
    * Cons: The search is limited to matching names. If there are many items containing that keyword, the search may not be efficient.

* **Alternative 2:** Find items in the current list that matches the keyword, and an attribute e.g. tag.
    * Pros: Users would be able to retrieve a specific item more efficiently.
    * Cons: Users need to remember the items' attributes.

### List Items `list`, `list l/LOCATION` or `list t/TAG`

#### Actual Implementation

The `list` feature allows users to list all items in the inventory based on the order they were added.
The `list l/LOCATION` and `list t/TAG` features allow users to list all items in a specific location
or with a specific tag respectively.

The Sequence Diagram below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user
keys in the command `list`:
![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `list` Command](images/ListStoreMandoSequenceDiagram.png)

The Sequence Diagram below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user
keys in the command `list l/kitchen`:
![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `list l/kitchen` Command](images/ListLocationSequenceDiagram.png)

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the list operation behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user execute `list` to list all the items in the inventory. `StoreMandoParser` takes in the user input and
determines the command word (list) and argument ("") respectively.

Step 2. An instance of `ListCommandParser` will be created, followed by a call on its `parse` method, taking in the
argument stated in step 1 (""), which will be initialised to true.

Step 3. The `parse` method will check for the validity of the user input. If valid, a new `ListCommand` instance will be
created and returned to `LogicManager` class via `StoreMandoParser` class.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">
:information_source: **Note:** If the command format is determined to be invalid, a parseException will be thrown to notify the
user of the error.
</div>

Step 4. The overridden `execute` method will be called. The current predicate and filtered item list of the `Model` will
be updated, and all items in the inventory will be listed. An instance of `CommandResult` will be created, generating
the result of the execution. The `LogicManager` class will receive the result of the execution.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes the list command:

![ListActivityDiagram](images/ListActivityDiagram.png)

#### Design consideration:

##### Aspect: How list executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** List the entire inventory in the order they were added.
    * Pros: Easy to implement.
    * Cons: The overview of all the items in the inventory may appear disorganised.

* **Alternative 2:** List the entire inventory categorised in their specific locations.
    * Pros: More organised overview of all the items in the inventory.
    * Cons: More difficult to implement.

_{more aspects and alternatives to be added}_

### Reminder Feature

The Sequence Diagram below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user
issues the command `reminder 1 week`.

![ReminderSequenceDiagram](images/ReminderWeeksSequenceDiagram.png)

The Sequence Diagram below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user
issues the command `reminder 3 days`.

![ReminderSequenceDiagram](images/ReminderDaysSequenceDiagram.png)

#### Actual Implementation

This portion describes the implementation of the reminder feature which allows users to view items that are expiring
within a certain number of days as specified by the user.

1. When the user keys in a command string, `execute` command of the `LogicManager` is called with the given string as input.
2. In the method, `LogicManager` calls on the `parseCommand` method of `StoreMandoParser` to parse the given command.
3. `StoreMandoParser` parses the command and determines that the command given is a `ReminderCommand`.
   Then, a `ReminderCommandParser` object is created to further parse the command.
4. `StoreMandoParser` then calls on the `parse` method of `ReminderCommandParser` to parse the arguments provided.
5. `ReminderCommandParser` calls on its own `timeConversion` method to convert the string into an integer. A
   `CommandParseException` will be thrown if this is not possible.
6. `ReminderCommandParser` then calls on the constructor of `ItemExpiringPredicate` with the integer as parameter to
   create an `ItemExpiringPredicate` object and then calls on the constructor of `ReminderCommand` with the `ItemExpiringPredicate` object as
   a parameter.
7. The `ReminderCommand` object will be created and returned to `StoreMandoParser` which returns it to `LogicManager`
8. `LogicManager` then calls on the `execute` method of `ReminderCommand` with `model` as argument.
9. `ReminderCommand` calls the `updateCurrentPredicate` method of `model` and passes its own `ItemExpiringPredicate`
   as argument.
10. `ReminderCommand` calls the `getCurrentPredicate` method of `model` to obtain the current predicate and uses it
    to update the list by calling on `updateFilteredItemList` method of `model` with the current predicate as argument.
11. `ReminderCommand` then creates a `ItemComparatorByExpiryDate` object and calls `model`'s `updateSortedItemList` with
    `ItemComparatorByExpiryDate` as argument to sort the list.
12. Finally, a `CommandResult` object is created and returned to `LogicManager`.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new `reminder` command:

![ReminderActivityDiagram](images/ReminderActivityDiagram.png)

#### Design consideration:

##### Aspect: How `reminder` executes

**Alternative 1 (current choice)** : provide an integer as an input argument
* Pros: Faster to type as compared to date in a particular format.
* Cons: More cases to consider when parsing the command.

**Alternative 2** : provide a date in the format of YYYY-MM-DD as input
* Pros: Easier to compare between items as the input date can be used to create an `expiryDate` object
which can be used to compare with all the items' expiry dates.
* Cons: When the user wants to find items that are already expired, it is easier to key in a number then to
find a particular date and key it in. This is more taxing on the user.


### Sort Feature `sort`

#### Actual Implementation

The `sort` feature allows users to view the items in the displayed list of items in a specific order.
The `sort quantity asc` and` sort quantity desc` commands allows users to view all items in the displayed list in 
ascending or descending order of quantity respectively. In comparison, the `sort expirydate` command allows users to 
view items in the displayed list in chronological order of their expiry date.

The Sequence Diagram below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user
issues the command `sort quantity asc`.

![SortSequenceDiagram](images/SortSequenceDiagram.png)

From the diagram above:
1. `LogicManager`'s `execute` is called when the user enters an input into the command box.
2. `LogicManager` then calls `parseCommand` of `StoreMandoParser` to parse the user input.
3.  The `StoreMandoParser` identifies the input as an `SortCommand` and initializes `SortCommandParser`.
4. `StoreMando` then invokes the method `parse` of `SortCommandParser` to further parse the user input.
   The `SortCommandParser` ensures that the input is of the correct format and identifies the type of 
   sorting to be done.
5. If all the arguments of the `sort quantity asc` command are valid, The `SortCommandParser` initiates a new 
   `SortAscendingQuantityCommand` object. This `SortAscendingQuantityCommand` object will be returned to the 
   `LogicManager`.
6. The `LogicManager` will then invoke the `execute` method of the `SortAscendingQuantityCommand` object.
7. The `SortAscendingQuantityCommand` object will then retrieve the currently displayed list of items through the 
   `getFilteredItemList` method of `Model`to check if there are items to be sorted.
8. If there are items to be sorted, `SortAscendingQuantityCommand` will create an `ItemComparatorByIncreasingQuantity` 
   comparator object that determines how any two items in the list should be compared.
9. `SortAscendingQuantityCommand` passes this comparator to `Model` through `Model`'s `updateSortedItemList` method 
   to sort the list of items. 
10. `SortAscendingQuantityCommand` will then call `setItems` method of `Model` and pass in the sorted list of items 
    retrieved from `Model` through it's `getSortedItemList` method. This would result in the sorted list of items
    being displayed.
    
11. Upon completion, `SortAscendingQuantityCommand` creates a `CommandResult` object and passes it back to `LogicManager`.
    
12. This `CommandResult` will be returned at the end by `LogicManager`.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a `sort quantity asc` command:
![SortActivityDiagram](images/SortActivityDiagram.png)


##### Design Considerations:

##### Aspect: Determining the implementation of sort as initial implementation of filtered list had no sorting capability.

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Maintain current implementation of filtered list and utilise a new sorted list to sort items.
    * Pros: Faster alternative and easy to implement as existing components need not be modified.
    * Cons: Have to ensure the toggling between sorted list and filtered list is done accurately for each command.

* **Alternative 2:** Change underlying list implementation from filtered list to a list that supports sorting.
    * Pros: Easy to maintain once implemented.
    * Cons: Changing of underlying list implementation introduces unnecessary complexity and delay as all the other components
      that depend on filtered list implementation would have to be changed as well.

### Clear Feature

This portion describes the implementation of the clear feature which allows users to clear items that are either in
a particular location or clear all items in the list.

The Sequence Diagram below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user
keys in the command `clear`

![ClearSequenceDiagram](images/ClearSequenceDiagram.png)

The Sequence Diagram below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user
keys in the command `clear l/Kitchen`

![ClearLocationSequenceDiagram](images/ClearLocationSequenceDiagram.png)

#### Actual Implementation 

1. When the user keys in a command string, `execute` command of the `LogicManager` is called with the given string as input.
2. In the method, `LogicManager` calls on the `parseCommand` method of `StoreMandoParser` to parse the given command.
3. `StoreMandoParser` parses the string and determines the command given is a `ClearCommand`.
    Then, a `ClearCommandParser` object is created to further parse the command.
4. `StoreMandoParser` then calls on the `parse` method of `ClearCommandParser` to parse the arguments provided.
5. `ClearCommandParser` checks if the argument provided is an empty string. If so, the constructor of `ClearCommand`
    without any parameters is called. Else, a `LocationContainsPredicate` object will be created with the arguments
    as parameter.`CommandParseException` will be thrown if this is not possible.
6. `ClearCommand` object will be returned to `ClearCommandParser` which then returns it to `LogicManager`. `LogicManager`
    then calls the `execute` method of `ClearCommand` with a `Model` object, model, as parameter.
7. `ClearCommand` calls on the `clearLocation` method of model with the `ClearCommand`'s attribute predicate as parameter.
    Subsequently, it calls on model's `updateFilteredItemList`.
8. Finally, a `CommandResult` object is created and is returned to `LogicManager`.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a clear by location command:

![ClearActivityDiagram](images/ClearLocationActivityDiagram.png)

### Help feature
The help feature redirects the user to StoreMando's User Guide. If the device is connected to the Internet, StoreMando 
will automatically open the User Guide in a new browser. Otherwise, it will have a pop out window with the User
Guide link. This will save the user the hassle of locating the documentation. <br>
The help command has the following format :`help`.

:information_source: : Things to note
- Even though the help command expects the user input to contain the `help` command keyword, it still allows users to
  append arguments. However, the arguments will not be parsed by StoreMando.

#### Implementation
![HelpSequenceDiagram](images/HelpSequenceDiagram.png)
Step 1: The user inputs `help` wanting to be redirected to the User Guide to learn more about StoreMando's command. <br>
Step 2: The input is passed to `LogicManager` in a form of a String. <br>
Step 3: The input string is passed to `StoreMandoParser` for it to be parsed. <br>
Step 4: The input string is separated into command keyword and arguments containing the prefixes with the updated item's
attribute. <br>
Step 5: StoreMandoParser recognise that it is a `Help` command and creates a `HelpCommand` object. <br>
Step 6: The `HelpCommand` is pass back to `LogicManager`. <br>
Step 7: `LogicManager` then execute the `HelpCommand`. <br>
Step 8: `HelpCommand` will create a `CommandResult` and pass to `LogicManager` with message stating
"Opened user guide information." <br>

#### Activity Diagram
![HelpActivityDiagram](images/HelpActivityDiagram.png)

#### Design Considerations
- Alternative 1 (Current choice): Automatically open a browser to StoreMando's User Guide when there is internet access.
    - Pros: User don't have to manually copy and paste the link on their browser.

- Alternative 2: Provide user the link to StoreMando's user guide.

### \[Proposed\] Data archiving

_{Explain here how the data archiving feature will be implemented}_

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Documentation, logging, testing, configuration, dev-ops**

* [Documentation guide](Documentation.md)
* [Logging guide](Logging.md)
* [Testing guide](Testing.md)
* [Configuration guide](Configuration.md)
* [DevOps guide](DevOps.md)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Appendix: Requirements**

### Product scope

**Target user profile**:

* household resident
* has a lot of items at home and cannot constantly keep track of their respective locations
* has a lot of perishable items with various expiry dates that are difficult to remember
* prefers desktop applications over other types
* fast typist
* prefers typing to using mouse
* comfortable using CLI applications

**Value proposition**: Every info of every item you have at home - all in one place. One command is all you have to key
in to add, delete or find for an item. StoreMando keeps track of everything you need so that you don't have to
physically search for an item to obtain information on it. Get everything you need from StoreMando - locations,
quantities and expiry dates.
